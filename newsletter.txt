Welcome to the new issue  of the <b>Aircraft Spotters Club</b> newsletter. First off, let me say 
that we cannot mail this newsletter to all of our members so as of now we are putting it
on the Web. Starting with the January 3rd newsletter, Tom Smith will no longer be mailing the
newsletter to any members.
